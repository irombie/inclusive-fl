## Contributing
0. Make sure your env is up to date by installing the requirements into your env via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Clone/pull the repository. `git pull origin main`
2. Install precommit hooks via `pre-commit install`. Once installed, this step can be skipped.
3. Switch to a new branch, something other than main, and possibly appropriately named so it reflects what the changes are about. `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
4. Make desired changes.
5. Commit to the new branch. `git add . ; git commit -m "<commit_msg>"
6. If precommit does not let you commit because it wants to format the file, repeat the above steps. You will now commit the formatted files.
7. Push the commits via git push -u origin <branch_name>`. Once you commit and push once to a branch, you can push by just typing `git push`. 😼
8. Create a pull request (PR) by heading to the repo's website and clicking on `compare & pull request`.
9. Give an easy to understand name and provide explanation on what the PR does.
10. Ask for reviews from team members. Wait for a day for people to give feedback. After that, once your PR gets approved by someone, merge to `main`.
11. YOU are AMAZING! 🥳🎉 Thank you for being such a valuable team member 💙
